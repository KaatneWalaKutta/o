Issue: Unauthorized File Upload via Impersonation

The Client Admin user is able to upload files through an unintended method, despite the absence of an upload functionality on the interface. This is achievable by appending the query string ?viewAs=client-manager to the manager document endpoint URL for a specific study.

Appending ?viewAs=client-manager allows the Client Admin to impersonate a Client Manager, as indicated by the appearance of the "Exit Client Manager View" button on the page. This impersonation enables the Client Admin to access the file upload option and upload documents in a section where they are not authorized to do so.

However, once uploaded, these documents cannot be deleted by the Client Admin, indicating improper access control and a lack of privilege separation between roles.
