Client-Side Remote Code Execution (RCE) via eval() Sink

The application utilizes a custom Streamlit component (JavascriptComponent) that exposes a dangerous sink. Analysis of the reconstructed source code from the exposed .map files reveals that the component accepts a property named js_code from the backend and passes it directly into a JavaScript eval() function.

The developer intentionally bypassed security linting (using // eslint-disable-next-line) to implement this functionality. Because eval() executes strings with the same privileges as the application, any compromise of the data stream or the backend's logic allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser context.

Eliminate eval(): Replace the dynamic execution of strings with a pre-defined library of "Safe Actions." If the component needs to get window dimensions, hardcode a getWindowSize() function and trigger it via a constant string (e.g., ACTION_GET_DIMENSIONS).

Remove Source Maps: Disable the generation of .map files in the production build pipeline to prevent attackers from reconstructing the application's internal logic.

Implement Content Security Policy (CSP): Deploy a strict CSP that disallows 'unsafe-eval' to provide a defense-in-depth layer that prevents the browser from executing code via eval() even if the sink remains.


Since environmental restrictions prevent active Hex injection, the vulnerability is proven via the leaked source code:










Sensitive Information disclosure: in websocket traffic:


The hex string you provided decodes into a structured data format, likely Protocol Buffers (protobuf), which is commonly used by Streamlit to synchronize state between the Python backend and the React frontend.
