# Pentest Notes – Frontend Reconstruction

This project was reconstructed from exposed JavaScript source maps.

Key risks identified:
- Full React source disclosure
- Client-side route & role logic visible
- API endpoints enumerable
- Business logic and workflow states exposed

This material can be used by an attacker to:
- Skip UI restrictions
- Target admin APIs directly
- Perform IDOR and privilege escalation testing

Mitigation:
- Disable source maps in production
- Enforce server-side authorization
- Block .map files at CDN/WAF
